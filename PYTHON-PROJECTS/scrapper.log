I had doubts about this phone but finally I made my mind and went ahead with the purchase. The phone is a mid-ranger and the expectations should be kept accordingly.Design: I purchased the Laser black color which looks classic and trendy. The lines on its back shimmer when you hold it in hand and change the angle. It looks good. The effect is not too much, acceptable. The form factor is boxy and it feels quite a deal while holding.

There's plenty of bloatware, yes, but you can remove and more (all the Google bloat like Assistant, Home, Music etc.) using Universal Android Debloater. It works without any lags, and feels premium with a heft and high quality finish at the back. The camera is meh, but I click about three photos every five years, so I couldn't care less.

Don't waste your money. I am a big fan of poco and was using poco f1 for 3 years almost. But got disappointed with X4. 1. Camera is utter waste. You will not like taking pictures from front camera itself. When you do what's app call, your image will appear like a plastic guy. 2. Phone has lagging issues, 3. Many times when you are on call, the caller voice gets disconnected for 2 to 3 seconds and gets connected again. I experienced this almost 70 percent on my calls.
